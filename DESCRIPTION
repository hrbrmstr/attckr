Description: MITRE ATT&CK is a globally-accessible knowledge base of 
    adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. 
    The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development
    of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, 
    in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.
    Tools are provided to analyze adversary tactics and techniques,
    build incident metrics, and identify high level program gaps 
    using the MITRE ATT&CK CTI Corpus.
